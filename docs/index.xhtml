<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p class="noindent">
  SLEEF stands for SIMD Library for Evaluating Elementary
  Functions. It implements manually <a class="underlined"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">vectorized</a>
  versions of all C99 real floating point math functions. It can
  utilize SIMD instructions that are available on modern
  processors. SLEEF is designed to effciently perform computation with
  SIMD instructions by reducing the use of conditional branches and
  scatter/gather memory access. Our <a class="underlined"
  href="benchmark.xhtml">benchmarks</a> show that the performance of
  SLEEF is comparable to that of the best commercial library.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike closed-source commercial libraries, which are often
  assembly-optimized, SLEEF is designed to work with various
  architectures, operating systems and compilers. It is distributed
  under <a class="underlined"
  href="http://www.boost.org/users/license.html">the Boost Software
  License</a>, which is a permissive open source license. SLEEF can be
  easily ported to other architectures by writing a helper file, which
  is a thin abstraction layer of SIMD intrinsics. SLEEF also
  provides <a class="underlined"
  href="additional.xhtml#dispatcher">dispatchers</a> that
  automatically choose the best subroutines for the computer on which
  the library is executed. In order to further optimize the
  application code that calls SLEEF functions,
  <a class="underlined" href="additional.xhtml#lto">link time
  optimization(LTO)</a> can be used to reduce the overhead of
  functions calls, and the build system of SLEEF supports usage of
  LTO. The library also has a functionality to generate
  <a class="underlined" href="additional.xhtml#inline">header
  files</a> in which the library functions are all defined as inline
  functions. SLEEF can be used for <a class="underlined"
  href="cuda.xhtml">GPGPU</a> and <a class="underlined"
  href="additional.xhtml#wasm">WebAssembly</a> with these header
  files. In addition to the vectorized functions, SLEEF provides
  scalar functions. Calls to these scalar SLEEF functions can be
  <a class="underlined"
  href="additional.xhtml#vectorizing">auto-vectorized</a> by GCC and
  Clang. These functions return deterministic values across all
  architectures. That is, they are designed to return exactly the same
  value for the same argument even on different architectures.
</p>

<p>
  The library contains implementations of all C99 real FP math
  functions in double precision and single precision. Different
  accuracy of the results can be chosen for a subset of the elementary
  functions; for this subset there are versions with up to
  1 <a class="underlined" href="additional.xhtml#ulp">ULP</a> error
  (which is the maximum error, not the average) and even faster
  versions with a few ULPs of error bounds. For non-finite inputs and
  outputs, the functions return correct results as specified in the
  C99 standard. All the functions in the library
  are <a class="underlined" href="misc.xhtml#testerlibm">thoroughly
  tested</a> and confirmed that the evaluation error is within the
  designed limit by comparing the returned values against
  high-precision evaluation using the GNU MPFR Library.
</p>

<p>
  SLEEF also includes a <a class="underlined"
  href="quad.xhtml">quad-precision math library</a>. This library
  includes fully vectorized IEEE 754 quadruple-precision (QP)
  functions that correspond to the standard C math functions. I/O
  functions for converting between QP numbers and strings are also
  available.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
  SLEEF includes a library of <a class="underlined"
  href="dft.xhtml">discrete Fourier transform(DFT)</a>. It is fully
  vectorized, heavily unrolled, and parallelized in such a way that
  modern SIMD instructions and multiple cores can be utilized, and it
  can utilize long vectors up to 2048 bits. It has an API similar to
  that of FFTW for easy migration. The helper files for abstracting
  SIMD intrinsics are shared with SLEEF libm, and thus it is easy to
  port the DFT library to other architectures. <a class="underlined"
  href="benchmark.xhtml#dft">Benchmark results of the DFT library</a>
  are now available.

<h3
id="building-a-sustainable-future-for-our-open-source-projects">Building
a Sustainable Future for Our Open Source Projects</h3>

<p class="noindent">We believe that Free and Open Source Software
(FOSS) is a wonderful ecosystem that allows anyone to use software
freely. However, to maintain and enhance its value over the long term,
continuous maintenance and improvement are essential.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">Like many FOSS projects, we face the challenge
that long-term sustainability is difficult to achieve through the
goodwill and efforts of developers alone. While the outputs of
open-source projects are incorporated into the products of many
companies and their value is rightfully recognized, the developers who
create these outputs are not always treated as equal partners in the
business world.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">A license guarantees the “freedom to use,” but the
spirit of the FOSS ecosystem is based on a culture of mutual respect
and contribution built upon that freedom. We believe that accepting
the “value” of a project’s output while unilaterally refusing dialogue
with its creators simply because they are individuals undermines the
sustainability of this ecosystem. Such companies should not turn a
blind eye to the reality that someone must bear the costs to make the
cycle sustainable.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">This issue is not just about corporations; it
reflects a deeper cultural expectation within the FOSS ecosystem
itself. Over time, we have come to take for granted that everything in
open source should be provided for free - not only the code, but also
the ongoing effort to maintain and improve it. However, FOSS licenses
guarantee the freedom to use and modify software; <strong>they do not
impose an obligation on developers to offer perpetual, unpaid
maintenance</strong>. When this distinction is overlooked, maintainers
can end up burdened with work that was never meant to be an open-ended
personal commitment. Such an imbalance not only discourages openness,
but also undermines the sustainability of an ecosystem that has become
a vital part of modern society.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">To explain the phenomenon occurring across the
entire ecosystem: Developers write code they find useful and release
it as FOSS. It gains popularity, and soon large corporations
incorporate it into their products, reaping substantial
profits. Requests for new features and fixes flood in, yet no
financial support accompanies them. Eventually, the maintainer
realizes there is no personal or professional benefit in responding to
these unpaid demands. The skills required to develop popular FOSS are
often in high demand in other fields as well.  Ultimately, the
maintainer burns out and the project is abandoned. This is the
unsustainable cycle we are tackling.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">Within this unsustainable cycle, adopting FOSS
into products while fully aware of this situation is hardly beneficial
for either companies or the society at large. To make the cycle
sustainable, everyone must recognize the reality that someone must
bear the costs, and these costs are equivalent to what companies would
need to develop and maintain comparable products. This project
specifically requests companies profiting from our deliverables to
contribute to maintaining the project.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">To be clear, <strong>this is not a request for
charity</strong>; it is a proposal to manage the operational
risk. This is a systemic challenge originating not from the
developers, but from within the organizations that consume and whose
business continuity depends on FOSS. Should a project be abandoned due
to this unresolved problem,
<strong>the primary victims will be you, the company</strong> that built
its product on top of an unmaintained foundation, not the developers who
can move on to other opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="our-request-for-support">Our Request for Support</h3>

<p class="noindent">We request ongoing financial support from
organizations that incorporate our project’s deliverables into their
products or services and derive <strong>annual revenue exceeding US $1
million</strong> from those products and services, to help cover the
costs of maintenance and the development of new features. While this
support is not a legal obligation, let us be clear: the license is a
grant of permission to use our work, not a service contract obligating
us to provide perpetual, unpaid labor. We consider it a fundamental
business principle that to profit from a critical dependency while
contributing nothing to its stability is an extractive and
unsustainable practice.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">It is also crucial to recognize what “maintenance”
truly entails. In a living software project, it is not merely about
preserving the status quo of the current version. It is the continuous
effort that leads to security patches, compatibility with new
environments, and the very features that define future
versions. Therefore, to claim satisfaction with an older version as a
reason to decline support, while simultaneously benefiting from the
ongoing development that produces newer, better versions, is a
logically inconsistent position.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">This support must not be intended to benefit any
particular company, but must support maintaining the project as a
shared infrastructure that
<strong>benefits all users and the broader community</strong>.
Furthermore, this threshold is designed so that <strong>individual
developers, small-scale projects, and the majority of our users are not
asked to pay</strong>, while seeking appropriate support from companies
that derive significant value from our project.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">We understand that corporate procurement processes
were not designed with FOSS sustainability in mind. We are committed
to finding a practical path forward, but your partnership is essential
in structuring a financial relationship that aligns with your standard
corporate procedures. We simply ask for fairness: do not demand
contractual terms from maintainers that your own legal department
would refuse to accept.  Our mutual goal is to treat this partnership
as a conventional operational expense, removing your internal barriers
and making sustainability a straightforward business practice.</p>

<br/>

<p class="noindent">Our goal is to maintain this project stably over
the long term and make it even more valuable for all users. In an
industry where many projects are forced to abandon FOSS licenses, our
preference is to continue offering this project under a true
open-source license.  However, the long-term viability of this
FOSS-first approach depends directly on the willingness of our
commercial beneficiaries to invest in the ecosystem they rely on. We
hope our collaborative approach can contribute to shaping a more
balanced and enduring future for FOSS.</p>
