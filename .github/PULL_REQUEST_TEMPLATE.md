Our project provides only the current and previous versions of
software free of charge. No other materials and services are provided
free of charge unless they are explicitly stated to be free of
charge.

Our project collects a fee from you to approve your PR. The specific
amount you need to pay will be determined by negotiation, depending on
the nature of the PR and your project. We will not charge a fee if you
are not making a profit from the deliverables of this project, or for
minor bug fixes that do not involve specification changes.

The fee you pay is for the review and does not include the cost of any
future maintenance of your code. Your code added by this PR may be
removed without notice if our project finds it necessary.

By becoming a sponsor of our project, no additional cost will be
charged to review your PR.

If you have any questions, please contact us before opening a PR.

Simply remove this notice when you open a PR.
