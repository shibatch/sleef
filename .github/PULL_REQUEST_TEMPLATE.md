Currently we do not have a sponsor for this project. That means that
the effort to review your PR is currently being covered entirely by
our good will. You may be happy if your PR is approved for now, but
please remember that we will need to maintain your code on a permanent
basis. Please consider sponsoring this project.

You do not need to agree to this CoC at this time. Simply remove this
notice when you open a PR.
