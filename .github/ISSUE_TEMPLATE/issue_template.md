Our project provides only the current and previous versions of
software free of charge. No other materials and services are provided
free of charge unless they are explicitly stated to be free of
charge.

If you want us to process your issue, you will need to pay a fee. The
specific amount you need to pay will be determined by negotiation,
depending on the nature of the issue and your project.

By becoming a sponsor of our project, you will receive a substantial
discount on the cost of processing your issue.

It is still possible to create an issue without paying a fee, but in
that case we will not process your issue.

If you have any questions, please contact us before creating an issue.

Simply remove this notice when you create an issue.
