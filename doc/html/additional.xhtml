<h3 id="dispatcher">How the dispatcher works</h3>

<p class="noindent">
  Fig. 7.1 shows a simplified code of our dispatcher. There is only
  one exported function <b class="func">mainFunc</b>. When
  <b class="func">mainFunc</b> is called for the first
  time, <b class="func">dispatcherMain</b> is called internally,
  since <i class="var">funcPtr</i> is initialized to the pointer to
  <b class="func">dispatcherMain</b>(line 14). It then detects if the
  CPU supports SSE 4.1(line 7), and
  rewrites <i class="var">funcPtr</i> to a pointer to the function
  that utilizes SSE 4.1 or SSE 2, depending on the result of CPU
  feature detection(line 10).  When
  <b class="func">mainFunc</b> is called for the second time, it does
  not execute the
  <b class="func">dispatcherMain</b>. It just executes the function
  pointed by the pointer stored in <i class="var">funcPtr</i> during
  the execution of
  <b class="func">dispatcherMain</b>.
</p>

<p>
  There are a few advantages in our dispatcher. The first advantage is
  that it does not require any compiler-specific extension. The second
  advantage is simplicity. There are only 18 lines of simple
  code. Since the dispatchers are completely separated for each
  function, there is not much room for bugs to get in.
</p>

<p>
  The third advantage is low overhead. You might think that the
  overhead is one function call including execution of prologue and
  epilogue. However, since modern compilers eliminate redundant
  execution of the prologue, epilogue and return instruction, the
  actual overhead is just one jmp instruction. This is very fast since
  it is not conditional.
</p>

<p>
  The fourth advantage is thread safety. There is only one variable
  shared among threads, which is <i class="var">funcPtr</i>. There are
  only two possible values for this pointer variable. The first value
  is the pointer to the <b class="func">dispatcherMain</b>, and the
  second value is the pointer to either <b class="func">funcSSE2</b>
  or <b class="func">funcSSE4</b>, depending on the availability of
  extensions. Once <i class="var">funcPtr</i> is substituted with the
  pointer to <b class="func">funcSSE2</b>
  or <b class="func">funcSSE4</b>, it will not be changed in the
  future. It is obvious that the code works in all the cases.
</p>

<h3>ULP, gradual underflow and flush-to-zero mode</h3>

<p class="noindent">
  ULP stands for "unit in the last place", which is sometimes used for
  measuring accuracy of calculations. 1 ULP is basically the distance
  between the two closest floating point number, which depends on the
  exponent of the FP number. The accuracy of calculations by reputable
  math libraries is usually between 0.5 and 1 ULP. Here, the accuracy
  means the largest error of calculation, which only happens in the
  worst case. SLEEF math library provides multiple accuracy choices
  for some math functions. Many functions have 3.5-ULP and 1-ULP
  versions, and 3.5-ULP versions are significantly faster than 1-ULP
  versions. If you care more about execution speed than accuracy, it
  is advised to use the 3.5-ULP versions along with -ffast-math or
  "unsafe math optimization" options for the compiler.
</p>

<p>
  In IEEE 754 standard, underflow does not happen abruptly when the
  exponent becomes zero. Instead, denormal numbers are produced which
  has less precision, and this is sometimes called gradual
  underflow. On some implementation which is not IEEE-754 conformant,
  flush-to-zero mode is used since it is easier to implement. In
  flush-to-zero mode, numbers smaller than the smallest normalized
  number cannot be represented, and it is replaced with zero. Because
  of this, the accuracy of calculation may be influenced in some
  cases. The smallest normalized precision number can be referred with
  DBL_MIN for double precision, and FLT_MIN for single precision. The
  naming of these macros is a little bit confusing because DBL_MIN is
  not the smallest double precision number.

<h3>About sincospi</h3>

<p class="noindent">
  The sincospi series of functions evaluates <i class="math">sin(
    &pi;<i class="var">a</i> )</i> and <i class="math">cos(
    &pi;<i class="var">a</i> )</i> simultaneously. These functions are
    added to SLEEF as of version 3.0. There are a few reasons that I
    added these functions.
</p>

<p>
  C standards include specifications for functions that evaluate
  trigonometric functions. In order to do calculations for evaluating
  these functions, reduction of an argument is required. This involves
  a multiple precision multiplication with <i class="math">&pi;</i>,
  which requires many operations of addition and multiplication. This
  is slow especially if accurate evaluation is required. By designing
  the function in a way that the argument is pre-multiplied
  by <i class="math">&pi;</i>, this reduction can be eliminated. This
  leads to faster and more accurate evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  The second reason is that sincospi functions are handy for
  implementing an FFT library. FFT libraries need to evaluate
  trigonometric functions for generating twiddle factors that is used in
  the butterfly operations. Since the butterfly operations are
  repeatedly applied, the error in twiddle factors accumulates. Thus, we
  want to make the error in twiddle factors as small as possible.  In an
  FFT of power-of-two size, twiddle factors are
  <i class="math">sin( &pi;<i class="var">m</i> /
    2<sup><i class="var">n</i></sup> )</i> where <i class="var">m</i>
    and <i class="var">n</i> are integer. If we just use the usual
    trigonometric functions defined in the C standards with the
    precision same as that used for butterfly operations, we already
    have error when calculating arguments, since
    &pi;<i class="var">m</i> / 2<sup><i class="var">n</i></sup> cannot
    be represented as a floating point value without error. On the
    other hand, if we use sincospi function, the argument can be
    accurately represented by a radix 2 FP number. Thus, we can
    calculate twiddle factors with better accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  The third reason is that sinpi is needed internally to implement
  gamma functions.
