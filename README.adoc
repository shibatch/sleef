== How to build SLEEF

The library itself does not have any additional dependency.

In order to build SLEEF, you need CMake 3.18+, and C and C++ compilers of the same version.
It is also recommended to have the following tools.

* Ninja
* Git

https://github.com/shibatch/tlfloat[TLFloat] is automatically downloaded if no suitable version is found on your system.

Some tests require:

* libssl and libcrypto, that can be provided by installing openssl.
* libm, libgmp and libmpfr
* libfftw.


The build procedure is as follows.

[arabic]
. Check out the source code from our GitHub repository

....
git clone https://github.com/shibatch/sleef
....

[arabic, start=2]
. Make a separate directory to create an out-of-source build

....
cd sleef && mkdir build
....

[arabic, start=3]
. Run cmake to configure the project

....
cmake -S . -B build
....

By default this will generate shared libraries. In order to generate
static libraries, pass option `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`.

For more verbose output add option `-DSLEEF_SHOW_CONFIG=ON`.

[arabic, start=4]
. Run make to build the project

....
cmake --build build -j --clean-first
....

[arabic, start=5]
. Run tests using ctests

....
ctest --test-dir build -j
....

For more detailed build instructions please refer to the
link:./docs/1-user-guide/build-with-cmake[dedicated section on CMake] or
to https://sleef.org/1-user-guide/#preliminaries[our web page].

== How to cross-compile SLEEF

For more detailed please refer to
link:./docs/1-user-guide#cross_linux[cross-compile SLEEF]

== Install SLEEF

=== From source

Assuming following instructions were followed.

[arabic, start=6]
. Install to specified directory `<prefix>`

....
cmake --install build --prefix=<prefix>
....

=== Uninstall

In order to uninstall SLEEF library and headers run

....
sudo xargs rm -v < build/install_manifest.txt
....
