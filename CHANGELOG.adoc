== 3.9 - 2025-03-27

The most significant change in this release is the rewriting of the DFT library in C++. This has made the code simpler, cleaner, and more stable. Next, tester4 has been introduced, which uses TLFloat instead of MPFR for testing. This allows for post-build testing in a wider range of environments than before. Various other changes were made to reduce project maintenance costs. For more information, see the list below.

== 3.8 - 2025-01-27

The focus of this release has been to facilitate benchmarking in SLEEF.
It does so by providing a benchmarking tool and a plotting tool to
postprocess the results. AArch64 self-hosted runners have been added to
CI. Following this, the Linux and compiler version have been updated.
Fix inaccuracy issues in a few functions, failures with cpp checks and a
few bugs. Finally, the project has been extended with a blog section and
its first blog https://sleef.org/2024/10/02/new-pulse.html[post].
