# Contributing to SLEEF

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SLEEF. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve this project.

However, to ensure the sustainability of the project and fairness among stakeholders, we have established specific policies for corporate contributors.

## Policy for Corporate Contributors

**In principle, organizations that meet the criteria below are required to agree to the following Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA).**

Many corporations routinely require their business partners to agree to similar provisions (such as unlimited liability and complete transfer of intellectual property). In fact, this project has explicitly been asked by corporate users of our products to agree to these exact types of clauses in the past.

Therefore, we recognize that agreeing to such clauses is a standard practice in business-to-business transactions and should **pose no obstacle** for corporate users wishing to contribute to this project.

### Scope of Application

This policy applies to contributions made on behalf of organizations that:

1.  Incorporate this project's deliverables into their products or services.
2.  Derive annual revenue exceeding **US $1 million** from those products or services.

**NOTE:** Individual contributors and small businesses that do not meet the above criteria are **NOT** required to agree to this CCLA. They may continue to contribute under the standard project license.

### Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) Terms:

1.  **Transfer of Intellectual Property:**
    You hereby assign to the Project Maintainer all right, title, and interest in and to this contribution, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein. The Project Maintainer shall be the sole and exclusive owner of the contribution.

2.  **Warranties:**
    You represent and warrant that this contribution is free from any defects, fit for the particular purpose of the Project, and does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party.

3.  **Indemnification & Unlimited Liability:**
    You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Project Maintainer from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, and expenses arising out of or resulting from this contribution. **Your liability under this agreement is UNLIMITED.**

### Authorized Exemption

We understand that some organizations may prefer not to agree to the terms above.

Organizations that enter into a separate Maintenance Support Agreement (which includes fair liability caps and mutual respect for IP) with the Project Maintainer are granted an **"Authorized Exemption"** status.

For inquiries regarding CCLA exemption, please contact the maintainers.
