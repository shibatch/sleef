# Contributing to Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve this project.

However, to ensure the sustainability of the project and fairness among stakeholders, we have established specific policies for corporate contributors.

## Policy for Corporate Contributors

**In principle, organizations that meet the criteria below are required to agree to the following Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA).**

Many corporations routinely require their business partners to agree to similar provisions (such as unlimited liability and complete transfer of intellectual property). In fact, this project has explicitly been asked by corporate users of our products to agree to these exact types of clauses in the past.

**This CCLA was created specifically in response to those experiences.** During funding negotiations, corporate partners presented us with agreements containing the very terms listed in the CCLA. When we expressed concerns about unlimited liability and IP transfer, we were told these were "standard business practices" and non-negotiable.

**As stated in our Code of Conduct, we believe corporate participants should treat open source maintainers as equal business partners.** This means not demanding contractual terms from maintainers that the corporation's own legal department would refuse to accept if presented by a counterparty.

If your legal team finds the terms in this CCLA unacceptable for your organization, we encourage you to consider why it was deemed acceptable to demand identical terms from this project's maintainers.

### Scope of Application

This policy applies to contributions made on behalf of organizations that:

1.  Incorporate this project's deliverables into their products or services.
2.  Derive annual revenue exceeding **US $1 million** from those products or services.

**NOTE:** Individual contributors and small businesses that do not meet the above criteria are **NOT** required to agree to this CCLA. They may continue to contribute under the standard project license.

### Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) Terms:

1.  **Transfer of Intellectual Property:**
    You hereby assign to the Project Maintainer all right, title, and interest in and to this contribution, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein. The Project Maintainer shall be the sole and exclusive owner of the contribution.

2.  **Warranties:**
    You represent and warrant that this contribution is free from any defects, fit for the particular purpose of the Project, and does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party.

3.  **Indemnification & Unlimited Liability:**
    You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Project Maintainer from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, and expenses arising out of or resulting from this contribution. **Your liability under this agreement is UNLIMITED.**

---

### Authorized Exemption

We understand that some organizations may prefer not to agree to the terms above.

Organizations that enter into a separate Maintenance Support Agreement (which includes fair liability caps and mutual respect for IP) with the Project Maintainer are granted an **"Authorized Exemption"** status.

If your organization cannot accept the terms in this CCLA (such as unlimited liability or complete IP transfer), then it would be inconsistent to demand that the project maintainer accept those same terms in a Maintenance Support Agreement. Organizations seeking an Authorized Exemption are expected to negotiate under terms they themselves would be willing to accept.

For inquiries regarding CCLA exemption, please contact the maintainers.
